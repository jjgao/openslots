## 🔄 Iteration Strategy

### After Each MVP:

1. **Demo** (30 min)
   - Show working features
   - Let receptionist try it
   - Gather immediate feedback

2. **Test** (1-2 hours)
   - Receptionist uses for real bookings (or realistic test)
   - Note pain points and bugs
   - Measure success criteria

3. **Retrospect** (30 min)
   - What worked well?
   - What needs improvement?
   - Should we adjust next MVP scope?

4. **Decide**
   - Continue to next MVP?
   - Fix critical issues first?
   - Adjust roadmap based on learning?

### Benefits of MVP Approach:

✅ **Early value**: Receptionists can start using after MVP 1
✅ **Fast feedback**: Learn what works before building too much
✅ **Reduced risk**: Each MVP is small and testable
✅ **Motivation**: Regular wins keep momentum
✅ **Flexibility**: Can reprioritize based on real usage
✅ **Focus**: Build only what's needed, not what's nice-to-have
